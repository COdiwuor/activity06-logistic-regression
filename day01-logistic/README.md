Day 1 - Logistic Regression
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.
- `activity06-logistic.Rmd` - the file you will complete in RStudio for
  this week.

## Task: Open the RMarkdown document and complete it

Read these directions first, then work through them.

- In the **Files** pane of RStudio, locate and click on the
  `activity06-logistic.Rmd` file to open it.

As you work through this activity, be descriptive in your response to
questions and even leave comments in your code to help you understand
what you are doing. These are your notes to yourself. How can you make
it easier for *future* your to remember what *current* you is
thinking/doing?

## What is next?

We will continue exploring classification models with *multinomial
regression*. This is an extension of logistic regression when our
response variable has more than two levels (i.e., from a multinomial
distribution instead of a binomial distribution).
