Day 2 & 3 - Multinomial Logistic Regression
================

In this repository/directory you should see one items:

- `README.md` - this document.
- `activity06-multinomial.Rmd` - the file you will complete in RStudio
  for this week.

## Task: Open the RMarkdown document and complete it

Read these directions first, then work through them.

- In the **Files** pane of RStudio, locate and click on the
  `activity06-multinomial.Rmd` file to open it.

As you work through this activity, be descriptive in your response to
questions and even leave comments in your code to help you understand
what you are doing. These are your notes to yourself. How can you make
it easier for *future* your to remember what *current* you is
thinking/doing?

## What is next?

Spring Break. When we return, we wrap up our “classification” module by
exploring generalized linear models (GLMs), then you will have your
second (and final) mini-competition.
